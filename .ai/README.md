# AI Entry Point

Baseline `0.6.0` · `P0: PASS` (frozen) · `P1-A0: COMPLETE` with its correctness closure ·
`P1: PASS / COMPLETE` (Analyze, evidence in `P1_VALIDATION/`) ·
`G1: PASS — basis P0 PASS, per ADR-0026 (2026-09-29)` · `active_task: NONE` ·
`V0: NON_BLOCKING_USER_FEEDBACK_TRACK, 0 / 8 honest zero` ·
`P2 / P3 / P4: NOT STARTED — each needs its own architect prompt` ·
`Pricing/commercial research: DEFERRED_POST_MVP`.

ADR-0026 changed **sequencing, not standards**: MVP is built first on engineering grounds, V0 no longer
gates it, and every technical boundary in `AGENTS.md` 2 / 7 / 11 still applies. With `active_task: NONE`,
item 6 binds absolutely: there is nothing to execute until the architect issues a prompt, and `P2 Compare`
being the next authorizable stage is a record, not an instruction to start it.

任何 AI 接手本项目时：

1. 读取根 `README.md`
2. 读取 `.ai/CURRENT_STATE.md`
3. 读取 `.ai/DECISIONS.md`
4. 读取 `.ai/ACTIVE_TASK.md`
5. 读取任务关联 ADR
6. 只执行 Active Task

## 不允许
- 自行从 roadmap 挑任务；
- 因为“更现代”替换技术栈；
- 加云、AI、账号系统；
- 扩大格式支持；
- 修改 baseline decision 而不写 ADR。
