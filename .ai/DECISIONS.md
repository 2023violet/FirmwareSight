# Decisions — v0.5.1

All v0.5.0 architecture/product/design decisions remain in force.

## V0 execution decisions

- The v1.1 execution prompt is authorized and preserved by SHA-256.
- V0 prototype is physically isolated under `V0_VALIDATION/`.
- No Cargo/Rust/Tauri/SQLite production implementation is created.
- MAP availability follows explicit STATE A→B timing.
- Parse failure is STATE C and preserves Last Good Artifact.
- Export controls are prototype-disabled; no E1 exporter is implemented.
- Review acceptance preserves original REVIEW and records disposition metadata.
- No mathematical V0 PASS threshold is invented.
- Formal V0 completion requires minimum N=8 eligible external sessions.

## Current Gate status

`V0 INCOMPLETE — insufficient external sample`

This is an evidence status, not a product-quality verdict.

It remains true after the P0 authorization below. V0 was re-sequenced as a non-blocking
research track; it was not completed, and no V0 participant evidence was created.

# P0 execution decisions — added 2026-09-27

Authorization:

- The P0 Technical Vertical Slice prompt v1.1 (Architect reviewed) is authorized and preserved
  by SHA-256 `60a59196708a53592be4d828a0c1275cf74b3bfad0bdc6455f863ab38d32929b`.
- Running P0 while V0 is unvalidated is not a new exception: `ADR-0020` already authorizes
  V0 and P0 as parallel tracks, with P1 gated on both.
- Only the execution state changed. No frozen product, architecture, evidence, gate or design
  baseline was altered, so no new architecture ADR was required to start.

Sequencing:

- V0 is now `DEFERRED / NOT YET EVIDENCE-VALIDATED`, a non-blocking research track.
- `0 / 8` external sessions stays on record; the Batch A hold on `v0.5.2` still stands.
- Formal G1 is not claimed while V0 is unvalidated, even if P0 passes.
- P1 requires a separate explicit authorization prompt.

Scope:

- First production code is created by this decision: Rust workspace, exactly four Phase-0
  library crates, `fwsight` CLI, minimal Tauri 2 shell, minimal React summary, fixtures,
  goldens, typed IPC, minimal SQLite, CI.
- `V0_VALIDATION/` is preserved read-only as research evidence; P0 code must not import the
  V0 static prototype into the production frontend.

Evidence-integrity rules accepted for this execution:

- Memory accounting must be proven from real ELF load/runtime evidence on a controlled fixture;
  a `.data` section-name heuristic may only be recorded as Derived/low-confidence and may never
  become a hard BLOCK basis.
- The GNU ld MAP adapter must produce at least one deterministic verified real fact; a detect
  plus capability claim alone does not count.
- Measured numbers only. Anything not measured is written as `NOT MEASURED` with a reason.
- LOCAL PASS, CI PASS and NOT RUN stay distinct; no unrun CI may be reported as green.
- Final status vocabulary is restricted to PASS / CONDITIONAL_PASS / FAIL / BLOCKED.

Observed environment facts that shaped the plan:

- The Rust toolchain matches the frozen pin exactly (1.98.1), so no baseline substitution was
  needed.
- The Tier 1 host is Windows, where the host C compiler emits PE/COFF rather than ELF, so real
  ELF fixtures come from `arm-none-eabi-gcc` instead of a host build.
- Installed pnpm is 11.21.0, below the baseline pnpm 12 line; corepack can resolve 12.7.0, so the
  baseline major line is kept rather than lowering it.

# P0 delivery record — added 2026-09-28, corrects one fact above

Corrections to the start-of-track observations:

- Corepack resolved **pnpm 12.6.0**, not 12.7.0. `apps/desktop/ui/package.json` now pins
  `packageManager: "pnpm@12.6.0"`, and every gate step runs it through `corepack pnpm`, so the
  lockfile is only ever resolved by the version that wrote it. The baseline's `pnpm 12` major line
  still holds; the assumption that 12.7.0 was available was wrong and is corrected here rather than
  silently rewritten above.

Decisions taken while executing, none of which moved a frozen baseline:

- `arm-none-eabi-gcc` supplies the ELF fixtures because the Windows host compiler emits PE/COFF. The
  binaries are committed with provenance, and tests are hash-first, so no test needs the toolchain.
- `firmwaresight-desktop` declares Tauri's template `custom-protocol` feature. Without it the
  release binary embeds no frontend, and the gate's `clippy --all-features` was the only step that
  made that visible. Recorded in `P0_IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md` 18.
- TypeScript is pinned to 6.0.3 because typescript-eslint requires `<6.1.0`; 7.0.2 was available and
  deliberately not taken.
- One golden file was deleted (`golden/reports/p0-basic-summary.json`) and one first-party unused
  dependency set was removed. Both are in the implementation log.

Final status and what it does not mean:

- P0 closes as `EXECUTED — CONDITIONAL_PASS (LOCAL)`. The conditions are external to this
  environment, not unfinished code: CI has never run and `cargo deny` has never run, both because
  there is no push authorization and the tool was not installed here.
- Baseline stays `0.5.1`. `v0.6.0` is reserved for an unconditional `PASS`, and `g1_claimed` stays
  `false`; P0 passing alone would not open G1 while V0 is unvalidated (ADR-0020).
- `sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS` fails on exactly six entries, all governance or execution records that
  P0 was authorized to change (`.ai/ACTIVE_TASK.md`, `.ai/CURRENT_STATE.md`, `.ai/DECISIONS.md`,
  `.ai/HANDOFF.md`, `10_AUDIT/SOURCE_PROMPTS/README.md`, `BASELINE.yaml`). `SHA256SUMS` is left as
  the v0.5.1 manifest; regenerating it would overwrite the frozen baseline's own integrity record,
  which is not P0's to do.
- P1 is not authorized and was not started.
